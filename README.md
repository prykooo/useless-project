Project Description
"An interactive vibe-check website that asks fun, quirky questions to gauge your mood and personality, giving playful feedback in real time."

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, people just want to know how their vibe is, but there's no easy or fun way to do it online. Why not create a silly, lighthearted vibe checker?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a website that asks quirky questions when users click "Check Your Vibe," giving instant feedback on their mood through fun messages and colors. Because who doesn’t want their vibes checked?
